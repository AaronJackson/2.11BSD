.SH NAME
ranlib \- table-of-contents for archive libraries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
ranlib [-t] file ...
.fi
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ranlib
creates a table of external references for archive libraries,
normally used by the loader,
.IR ld (1) .
This table is is named ``__.SYMDEF'' and is prepended to the archive.
Files in the archive which are not executable and symbols which are
uninteresting to the loader are ignored.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
\-t
Set the modification time of the __.SYMDEF file.
This time is compared by the loader with the modification time of the
archive to verify that the table is up-to-date with respect to the
archive.
If the modification time has been changed without any change to the
archive (for example, by a
.IR cp (1) ) ,
the
.I \-t
option can be used to ``touch'' the modification time so that it
appears that the table is up-to-date.
