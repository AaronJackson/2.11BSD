.I file1 \&... fileN directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are moved (or copied if the
.B\-c
option is specified) to the target file or directory.
If the destination is a directory, then the
.I file
is moved into
.I directory
with its original filename.
If the target file already exists, it is overwritten if permissions
allow.
.TP 8
.B\-c
Copy the file.
This flag turns off the default behavior of
.B install
where it deletes the original file after creating the target.
.TP 8
.B\-f
Specify the target's file flags.
(See
chflags(1)
for a list of possible flags and their meanings.)
.TP 8
.B\-g
Specify a group.
.TP 8
.B\-m
Specify an alternate mode.
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
chmod(1)
for a description of possible mode values.
.TP 8
.B\-o
Specify an owner.
.TP 8
.B\-s
.B Install
exec's the command
strip(1)
to strip binaries so that install can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.
.PP
By default,
.B install
preserves all file flags, with the exception of the ``nodump'' flag.
.PP
The
.B install
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.PP
Installing
.I /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.PP
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of 1 is returned.
