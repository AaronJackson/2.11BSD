Forget about using the original (non-overlaid) Makefile; f77 is so big
now that it can't run without overlays, even given separate i/d.

Ovmakefile.-n is essentially the original Ovmakefile; Ovmakefile.-i
takes advantage of separate i/d to cut down (drastically) on the number
of overlays needed.  In addition, moving selected tables into i-space
both doesn't work and isn't needed given split i/d; thus, it isn't
attempted.

Defs has been hacked for larger internal compiler table sizes.  This
will only work with separate i/d; copy defs.orig onto defs if you are
running a non-split i/d machine.

Error.c has been trivially (and dirtily) hacked to give a decent
diagnostic message on FATAL and FATAL1 compiler errors.  The message
was there all along; however, f77pass1 used to exit before emitting the
message text.

Take note that you may need to remake yacc before you can remake
f77pass1.  F77pass1 needs lots of yacc table space.
