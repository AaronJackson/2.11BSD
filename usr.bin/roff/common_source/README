The version of [nt]roff in this directory
is changed somewhat from the version you
may be used to.

1. fonts are in /usr/share/font/ftXX,
where XX is the name of the font (e.g., HI).
Source is in ./font/ftXX.c.

2. macro files like -ms are searched for in
/usr/share/tmac/tmac.xxx.
Your /usr/share/tmac may have to be changed.
The .so request has been modified to make it a
fatal error to try .so non-existent-file;
this should head off people who are explcitly 
including /usr/share/tmac.s, etc.

3. terminal driving tables for nroff are
in /usr/share/term/tabxxx instead of /usr/share/term/xxx.
