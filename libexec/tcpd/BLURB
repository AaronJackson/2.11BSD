This patch improves portability and backwards compatibility. It does
not add any new features. If 7.0 or 7.1 works for you don't bother.

    - Added a note to the README and to the manpages on using the IDENT
    (rfc931) service to detect sequence number guessing attacks.

    - Portability: support for the ConvexOS inetd.conf file format.

    - Portability: the AIX compiler complained about a declaration that
    was no longer needed.

    - Backwards compatibility: some sites depended on leading and
    trailing dot patterns for daemon process names.

    - Backwards compatibility: hostname lookup remains enabled when
    -DPARANOID is turned off. In order to disable hostname lookups you
    must turn off -DALWAYS_HOSTNAME.

    - Eliminated several false complaints from the tcpdmatch/tcpdchk
    configuration checking programs.

As always, suggestions for improvement are welcome.
