Well... Go read "why-tap.txt". More or less the same arguments
apply for the IDENT protocol. :-)

I'm not sure the "rfc931-users" mailing list is alive anymore though.
I've created a new mailing list "ident-users@lysator.liu.se" that you
may wish to join instead. Send email to "ident-users-request@lysator.liu.se"
to join/leave that list.
