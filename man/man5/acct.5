.SH NAME
acct \- execution accounting file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/acct.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR acct (2)
system call arranges for entries to be made in an accounting file
for each process that terminates.
The accounting file is a sequence of entries whose layout,
as defined by the include file is:
.PP
.nf
.ta \w'typedef 'u +\w'ACOMPAT  'u +\w'ac_comm[10];   'u
.so /usr/include/sys/acct.h
.fi
.PP
If the process was created by an
.IR execve (2),
the first 10 characters of the filename appear in
.I ac_comm.
The accounting flag contains bits indicating whether
.IR execve (2)
was ever accomplished, and whether the process ever had super-user privileges.
