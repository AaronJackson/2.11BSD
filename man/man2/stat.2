.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Stat
obtains information about the file
.IR path .
Read, write or execute
permission of the named file is not required, but all directories
listed in the path name leading to the file must be reachable.
.PP
.I Lstat
is like \fIstat\fP except in the case where the named file is a symbolic link,
in which case
.I lstat
returns information about the link,
while
.I stat
returns information about the file the link references.
.PP
.I Fstat
obtains the same information about an open file
referenced by the argument descriptor, such as would
be obtained by an \fIopen\fP call.
.PP
.I Buf
is a pointer to a
.I stat
structure into which information is placed concerning the file.
The contents of the structure pointed to by
.I buf
.PP

st_atime
Time when file data was last read or modified.  Changed by the following system
calls:
.IR mknod (2),
.IR utimes (2),
.IR read (2),
and
.IR write (2).
For reasons of efficiency, 
st_atime is not set when a directory
is searched, although this would be more logical.
.TP 12
st_mtime
Time when data was last modified.
It is not set by changes of owner, group, link count, or mode.
Changed by the following system calls:
.IR mknod (2),
.IR utimes (2),
.IR write (2).
.TP 12
st_ctime
Time when file status was last changed.
It is set both both by writing and changing the i-node.
Changed by the following system calls:
.IR chmod (2)
.IR chown (2),
.IR link (2),
.IR mknod (2),
.IR rename (2),
.IR unlink (2),
.IR utimes (2),
.IR write (2).

The status information word \fIst_mode\fP has bits:

The mode bits 0000070 and 0000007 encode group and
others permissions (see
.IR chmod (2)).
.SH "RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH "ERRORS
.I Stat
and
.I lstat
will fail if one or more of the following are true:
.TP 15
[ENOTDIR]
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.TP 15
[EINVAL]
The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit set.
.TP 15
[ENAMETOOLONG]
A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters,
or an entire path name exceeded 1023 characters.
.TP 15
[ENOENT]
The named file does not exist.
.TP 15
[EACCES]
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
.TP 15
[ELOOP]
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.TP 15
[EFAULT]
.I Buf
or
.I name
points to an invalid address.
.TP 15
[EIO]
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.PP
.I Fstat
will fail if one or both of the following are true:
.TP 15
[EBADF]
.I Fildes
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.TP 15
[EFAULT]
.I Buf
points to an invalid address.
.TP 15
[EIO]
An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.SH CAVEAT
The fields in the stat structure currently marked 
.IR st_spare1 ,
.IR st_spare2 ,
and
.I st_spare3
are present in preparation for inode time stamps expanding
to 64 bits.  This, however, can break certain programs that
depend on the time stamps being contiguous (in calls to
.IR utimes (2)).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
chmod(2), chown(2), utimes(2)
.SH BUGS
Applying
.I fstat
to a socket (and thus to a pipe)
returns a zero'd buffer,
except for the blocksize field,
and a unique device and inode number.
