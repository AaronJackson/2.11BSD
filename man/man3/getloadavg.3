.SH NAME
getloadavg \- get system load averages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

       double loadavg[];
       int    nelem;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIgetloadavg\fP
function returns the number of processes in the system run queue
averaged over various periods of time.
Up to
\fInelem\fP
samples are retrieved and assigned to successive elements of
\fIloadavg\fP.
The system imposes a maximum of 3 samples, representing averages
over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes, respectively.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If the load average was unobtainable, \-1 is returned; otherwise,
the number of samples actually retrieved is returned.
.SH SEE ALSO
uptime(1), sysctl(3), sysctl(8).
.SH HISTORY
The
.B getloadavg
function appeared in \fB4.3BSD-Reno\fP.
.PP
This function replaces the 2.9BSD compatibility routine getla().
