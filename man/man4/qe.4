.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B qe
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network through
the DEC DEQNA Q-bus controller.
.PP
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an SIOCSIFADDR
ioctl.  The
.B qe
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
arp(4P)
to map dynamically  between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.PP
The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsulation
to minimize copying data on input and output.
The use of trailers is negotiated with ARP.
This negotiation may be disabled, on a per-interface basis,
by setting the IFF_NOTRAILERS
flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.
