.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Adb
is a general purpose debugging program.
It may be used to examine files and to provide
a controlled environment for the execution of UNIX programs.
.PP
.I Objfil
is normally an executable program file, preferably
containing a symbol table; if not then the symbolic features of
.I  adb
cannot be used although the file can still be examined.
The default for
.I objfil
is
.B  a.out.
.I Corfil
is assumed to be a core image file produced after executing
.IR objfil ;
the default for
.I corfil
is
.B  core.
.PP
Requests to
.I  adb
are read from the standard input and responses are to the standard output.
If the
.B  \-w
flag is present then both
.I  objfil
and
.I corfil
are created if necessary and opened for reading and writing
so that files can be modified using
.IR adb .
.PP
The \fB\-k\fP option makes \fIadb\fP do UNIX kernel memory
mapping; it should be used when \fIcore\fP is a UNIX crash dump
or \fI/dev/mem\fP.
.PP
The \fB\-I\fP option specifies a directory where files to be read
with $< or $<< (see below) will be sought; the default is
.IR /usr/share/adb .
.PP
.I Adb
ignores QUIT; INTERRUPT causes return to the next
.I adb
command.
.PP
In general requests to
.I  adb
are of the form
.PP
.if n .ti 16
.if t .ti 1.6i
[\|\fIaddress\fR\|]  [\|,
.IR count \|]
[\|\fIcommand\fR\|] [\|;\|]
.PP
If
.I address
is present then
.I  dot
is set to
.IR address .
Initially
.I dot
is set to 0.  For most commands
.I count
specifies how many times the command will be executed.  The default
.I count
is 1.
.I Address
and
.I count
are expressions.
.PP
The interpretation of an address depends on the context it is used in.
If a subprocess is being debugged then addresses are interpreted
in the usual way in the address space of the subprocess.
For further details of address mapping see
.SM ADDRESSES.
.SH EXPRESSIONS
.TP 7.2n
.B .
The value of
.IR dot .
.TP 7.2n
+
The value of
.I dot
incremented by the current increment.
.TP 7.2n
^
The value of
.I dot
decremented by the current increment.
.TP 7.2n
"
The last
.I address
typed.
.TP 7.2n
.I integer
An octal number if
.I integer
begins with a 0;
a hexadecimal number if preceded by
.BR # ;
otherwise a decimal number.
This default interpretation of integers may be changed via the $o and $d
commands.
.TP 7.2n
.IB integer . fraction
A 32 bit floating point number.
.TP 7.2n
.I \'cccc\|\'
The ASCII value of up to 4 characters.
\e may be used to escape a \'.
.TP 7.2n
.I \*(LT name
The value of
.IR name ,
which is either a variable name or a register name.
.I Adb
maintains a number of variables (see
.SM VARIABLES\*S)
named by single letters or digits.
If
.I name
is a register name then the value of the register is obtained from
the system header in
.IR corfil .
The register names are those printed by the $r command.
.TP 7.2n
.I symbol
A
.I symbol
is a sequence of upper or lower case letters, underscores or
digits, not starting with a digit.  The backslash character
.B \e 
may be used to escape other characters.  The value of the
.I symbol
is taken from the symbol table in
.IR objfil .
An initial \_ or \*(TW will be prepended to
.I symbol
if needed.
If the symbol is a text symbol and
.I objfil
is an overlay type, the default is
.IR \*(TWsymbol ,
which is the subroutine itself, not the entry interface in the base segment.
.TP
.I _ symbol
In C, the `true name' of an external symbol begins with _.
It may be necessary to utter this name to distinguish it
from internal or hidden variables of a program.
For a subroutine in an overlay,
.I \*(TWsymbol 
is the actual subroutine,
and
.I _symbol
is the entry point in the base segment (the "thunk").
Note that to explicitly specify the local name,
the \*(TW must be preceeded by a backslash, since \*(TW is the
bitwise complement operator:
.I \e\*(TWsymbol
must be typed.
.TP 7.2n
.IB routine . name
The address of the variable
.I name
in the specified C routine.  Both
.I routine
and
.I name
are
.IR symbols .
If
.I name
is omitted the value is the address of the most recently activated C stack frame
corresponding to
.IR routine .
.TP 7.2n
.RI ( exp \|)
The value of the expression
.IR exp .
.LP
.SM
.B  "Monadic\ operators"
.TP 7.2n
.RI \*(ST exp
The contents of the location addressed by
.I exp
in
.IR corfil .
.TP 7.2n
.RI @ exp
The contents of the location addressed by
.I exp
in
.IR objfil .
.TP 7.2n
.RI \- exp
Integer negation.
.TP 7.2n
.RI \*(TW exp
Bitwise complement.
.LP
.tr ''
.B  "Dyadic\ operators"

Integer subtraction.
.TP 7.2n
.IR e1 \*(ST e2
Integer multiplication.
.TP 7.2n
.IR e1 % e2
Integer division.
.TP 7.2n
.IR e1 & e2
Bitwise conjunction.
.TP 7.2n
.IR e1 \(bv e2
Bitwise disjunction.

.SH COMMANDS
Most commands consist of a verb followed by a modifier or list of modifiers.
The following verbs are available.
(The commands `?' and `/' may be followed by `\*(ST'; see
.SM ADDRESSES
for further details.)
.TP .5i
.RI ? f
Locations starting at
.I address
in
.I  objfil
are printed according to the format
.IR f .
.I dot
is incremented by the sum of the increments for each format letter (q.v.).
.TP
.RI / f
Locations starting at
.I address
in
.I  corfil
are printed according to the format
.I f
and
.I dot
is incremented as for `?'.
.TP
.RI  = f
The value of
.I address
itself is printed in the styles indicated by the format
.IR f .
(For
.B i 
format `?' is printed for the parts of the instruction that reference
subsequent words.)
.PP
A
.I format
consists of one or more characters that specify a style of printing.
Each format character may be preceded by a decimal integer
that is a repeat count for the format character.
While stepping through a format
.I dot
is incremented temporarily by the amount given for each format letter.
If no format is given then the last format is used.
The format letters available are as follows.

of 1.
.TP
.RB [ ?/ ] l "\fI value mask\fR"
Words starting at
.I  dot
are masked with
.I mask
and compared with
.I value
until a match is found.
If
.B L
is used then the match is for 4 bytes at a time instead of 2.
If no match is found then
.I dot
is unchanged; otherwise
.I dot
is set to the matched location.
If
.I mask
is omitted then \-1 is used.
.TP
.RB [ ?/ ] w "\fI value ...\fR"
Write the 2-byte
.I value
into the addressed location.  If the command is

write 4 bytes.
Odd addresses are not allowed when writing to the subprocess address space.
.TP
[\fB?/\fR]\fBm\fI b1 e1 f1\fR[\fB?/\fR]
.br
New values for
.RI ( b1,\ e1,\ f1 )
are recorded.  If less than three expressions are given then
the remaining map parameters are left unchanged.
If the `?' or `/' is followed by `\*(ST' then
the last segment (\fIb2\fR\|,\|\fIe2\fR\|,\|\fIf2\fR)
of the mapping is changed.
If the list is terminated by `?' or `/' then the file (\fIobjfil\fR or
.I corfil
respectively) is used for subsequent requests.
(So that, for example, `/m?' will cause `/' to refer to
.IR objfil .)
.TP
.BI \*(GT name
.I Dot
is assigned to the variable or register named.
.TP
.B !
A shell (/bin/sh) is called to read the rest of the line following `!'.
.TP
.RI $ modifier
Miscellaneous commands.  The available 
.I modifiers 
are:
.RS
.TP
.BI < f
Read commands from the file
.IR f .
If this command is executed in a file, further commands
in the file are not seen.
If
.I f
is omitted, the current input stream is terminated.  If a
.I count
is given, and is zero, the command will be ignored.
The value of the count will be placed in variable
.I 9
before the first command in
.I f
is executed.
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI << f
Similar to
.B <
except it can be used in a file of commands without
causing the file to be closed.  Variable
.I 9
is saved during the execution of this command, and restored when it completes.
There is a (small) finite limit to the number of
.B <<
files that can be open at once.
.br
.ns
.TP
.BI > f
Append output to the file
.IR f ,
which is created if it does not exist.  If
.I f
is omitted, output is returned to the terminal.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B ?
Print process id, the signal which caused stoppage or termination,
as well as the registers as \fB$r\fR.  This is the default if
\fImodifier\fR is omitted.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B r
Print the general registers and the instruction addressed by
.BR pc .
.I Dot
is set to \fBpc\fR.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B f
Print the floating registers in
single or double length.
If the floating point status of
.B ps
is set to double (0200 bit)
then double length is used anyway.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B b
Print all breakpoints and their associated counts and commands.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B a
ALGOL 68 stack backtrace.
If
.I address
is given then it is taken to be the
address of the current frame (instead of
.BR r4 ).
If
.I count
is given then only the first
.I count
frames are printed.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B c
C stack backtrace.  If
.I address
is given then it is taken as the address of the current frame 
instead of the contents of the frame\-pointer register.  If
.B C 
is used then the names and (16 bit) values of all automatic
and static variables are printed for each active function.
If
.I count
is given then only the first
.I count
frames are printed.
.br
.ns
.TP
.B e
The names and values of external variables are printed.
.br

Print the address map.
.RE
.TP
.BI : modifier
Manage a subprocess.  Available modifiers are:
.RS
.TP
.BI b c
Set breakpoint at
.IR address .
If
.I objfil
is overlaid and
.I address
is in the overlay region,
the breakpoint is set in the overlay of the symbol mentioned
if 
.I address
was given symbolically, otherwise it is set
in the current overlay (that in variable c).
The breakpoint is executed
.IR count \-1
times before causing a stop.
Each time the breakpoint is encountered the command
.I c
is executed.  If this command is omitted or sets
.I dot
to zero then the breakpoint causes a stop.
.TP
.B d
Delete breakpoint at
.IR address .
.TP
.B r
Run
.I objfil
as a subprocess.  If
.I address
is given explicitly then the program is entered at this point; otherwise
the program is entered at its standard entry point.
.I count
specifies how many breakpoints are to be ignored before stopping.
Arguments to the subprocess may be supplied on the same line as the command.
An argument starting with < or > causes the standard
input or output to be established for the command.
.TP
.BI c s
The subprocess is continued with signal
.I s,
see
.IR sigvec (2).
If
.I address
is given then the subprocess is continued at this address.
If no signal is specified then the signal
that caused the subprocess to stop is sent.
Breakpoint skipping is the same as for
.BR r .
.TP
.BI s s
As for
.B c 
except that the subprocess is single stepped
.I count
times.  If there is no current subprocess then
.I objfil
is run as a subprocess as for
.BR r .
In this case no signal can be sent; the remainder of the line
is treated as arguments to the subprocess.
.TP
.B k
The current subprocess, if any, is terminated.
.RE
.SH VARIABLES
.I Adb
provides a number of variables.
Named variables are set initially by
.I  adb
but are not used subsequently (except for c).
Numbered variables are reserved for communication as follows.
.TP
0
The last value printed.
.br
.ns
.TP
1
The last offset part of an instruction source.
.br
.ns
.TP
2
The previous value of variable 1.
.br
.ns
.TP
9
The count on the last $< or $<< command.
.PP
On entry the following are set from the system header in the
.IR corfil .
If
.I corfil
does not appear to be a
.B core 
file then these values are set from
.IR objfil .
.TP
b
The base address of the data segment.
.br
.ns
.TP
c
The current overlay.  This is set from
.IR corfil ,
and in turn sets the overlay map.
This variable and the map may be changed
by referring to other overlays symbolically
(e.g. by examining text in subroutines in other overlays),
using the $r command (which resets c from the core file),
or explicitly (with the command >c).
.br
.ns
.TP
d
The data segment size.
.br
.ns
.TP
e
The entry point.
.br
.ns
.TP
m
The `magic' number (0405, 0407, 0410, 0411, 0430 or 0431).
The object is overlaid if m is 0430 or 0431.
.br
.ns
.TP
o
The sum of the overlay segment sizes (if overlaid).
.br
.ns
.TP
s
The stack segment size.
.br
.ns
.TP
t
The text segment size.
.SH ADDRESSES
The address in a file associated with
a written address is determined by a mapping associated with that file.
Each mapping is represented by two or three triples
.RI ( "b1, e1, f1" ),
.RI ( "bo, eo, fo" )
for overlaid object files,
and
.RI ( "b2, e2, f2" )
and the
.I file address
corresponding to a written
.I address
is calculated as follows.
.PP
.if t .ti 1.5i
.if n .ti 8
.IR b1 \*(LE address < e1
\*(IM
.IR "file address" = address + f1\-b1,
otherwise,
.PP
if overlaid,
.if t .ti 1.5i
.if n .ti 8
.IR bo \*(LE address < eo
\*(IM
.IR "file address" = address + fo\-bo,
otherwise,
.PP
.if t .ti 1.5i
.if n .ti 8
.IR b2 \*(LE address < e2
\*(IM
.IR "file address" = address + f2\-b2,
.PP
otherwise, the requested
.I address
is not legal.  In some cases (e.g. for programs with separated I and D
space) the two segments for a file may overlap.  If a
.B ? 
or
.B / 
is followed by an
.B \*(ST 
then only the last triple is used.
.PP
The initial setting of both mappings is suitable for normal
.B a.out 
and
.B core 
files.  If the object file is not of the kind expected then, for both files,
.I b1
is set to 0,
.I e1
is set to the maximum file size and
.I f1
is set to 0; in this way the whole
file can be examined with no address translation.
.PP
So that
.I adb
may be used on large files all appropriate values are kept as
signed 32 bit integers.

Exit status is 0, unless last command failed or returned nonzero status.
.SH BUGS
When single stepping, system calls do not count as an
executed instruction.
.br
Local variables whose names are the same as an external
variable may foul up the accessing of the external.
.br
Local variables cannot be accessed in routines that are in overlays.
.br
Since no shell is invoked to interpret the arguments of the
.B :r
command, the customary wild-card and variable expansions cannot occur.
