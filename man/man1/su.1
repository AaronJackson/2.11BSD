.SH NAME
su \- substitute user id temporarily
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B su
[ \-f ] [ \- ] [ userid ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Su
demands the password of the specified
.I userid,
and if it is given,
changes to that 
.I userid
and invokes the Shell
.IR sh (1)
or
.IR csh (1)
without changing the current directory.
The user environment
is unchanged except for HOME and SHELL,
which are taken from the password file
for the user being substituted
(see
.IR environ (7)).
The new user ID stays in force until the Shell exits.
.PP
If no 
.I userid
is specified, ``root'' is assumed.
Only users in the ``wheel'' group (group 0) can
.I su
to ``root'', even with the root password.
To remind the super-user of his responsibilities,
the Shell substitutes `#' for its usual prompt.
.PP
The
.B \-f
option prevents
.IR csh (1)
from executing the .cshrc file; thus making
.I su
start up faster.
.PP
The
.B \-
option simulates a full login.
