.SH SYNOPSIS
.B units
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Units
converts quantities expressed
in various standard scales to
their equivalents in other scales.
It works interactively in this fashion:
.PP
.I "	You have:"
inch
.br
.I "	You want:"
cm
.br
.I "		* 2.54000e+00
.br
.I "		\*/ 3.93701e\-01
.PP
A quantity is specified as a multiplicative combination of
units optionally preceded by a numeric multiplier.
Powers are indicated by suffixed positive integers,
division by the usual sign:
.PP
.I "	You have:"
15 pounds force/in2
.br
.I "	You want:"
atm
.br
.I "		* 1.02069e+00"
.br
.I "		\*/ 9.79730e\-01"
.PP
.I Units 
only does multiplicative scale changes.

Fahrenheit.

abbreviations, and metric prefixes are recognized,
together with a generous leavening of exotica
and a few constants of nature including:
.PP
