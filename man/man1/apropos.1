.SH NAME
apropos \- locate commands by keyword lookup
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B apropos
keyword ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Apropos
shows which manual sections contain instances of any of the given
keywords in their title.
Each word is considered separately and case of letters is ignored.
Words which are part of other words are considered; thus, when looking for
compile, \fIapropos\fP will find all instances of `compiler' also.
Try
.IP
apropos password
.PP
and
.IP
apropos editor
.PP
If the line starts `name(section) ...' you can do
`man section name' to get the documentation for it.
Try `apropos format' and then `man 3s printf' to get the manual
on the subroutine
.I printf.
.PP
.I Apropos
is actually just the
.B \-k
option to the
.IR man (1)
command.
