.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tcopy
is designed to copy magnetic tapes.  The only assumption made about
the tape is that there are two tape marks at the end.
.I Tcopy
with only a source tape specified will print information about the
sizes of records and tape files.  If a destination is specified,
then, a copy will be made of the source tape.  The blocking on the
destination tape will be identical to that used on the source tape.
Copying a tape will yield the same output as if just printing the
sizes.
