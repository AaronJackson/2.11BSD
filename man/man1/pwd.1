.SH NAME
pwd \- working directory name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pwd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pwd
prints the pathname of the working (current) directory.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
cd(1), csh(1), getwd(3)
.SH BUGS
In
.IR csh (1)
the command
.I dirs
is always faster (although it can give a different answer in the rare case
that the current directory or a containing directory was moved after
the shell descended into it).
