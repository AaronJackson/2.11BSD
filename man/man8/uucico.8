.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Uucico
performs the actual work involved in transferring files between
systems. 
.IR Uucp (1)
and
.IR uux (1)
merely queue requests for data transfer which
.I uucico
processes.
.PP
The following options are available.
.TP 8
.BI \-d spooldir
Use
.I spooldir
as the spool directory. The default is /usr/spool/uucp.
.TP 8
.BI \-g grade
Only send jobs of grade
.I grade
or higher this transfer.
The grade of a job is specified when the job is queued by
.I uucp
or
.IR uux .
.TP 8
.BI \-r role
.I role
is either 1 or 0; it indicates whether
.I uucico
is to start up in 
master or slave role, respectively. 1 is used when running 
.I uucico
by hand or from
.IR cron (8).
0 is used when another system calls the local system.
Slave role is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-R
Reverse roles.  When used with the
.B \-r1
option, this tells the remote system to begin sending its
jobs first, instead of waiting for the local machine to finish.
.TP 8
.BI \-s system
Call only system
.IR system .
If 
.B \-s
is not specified, and \-r1 is specified,
.I uucico
will attempt to call all systems for which there is work.
If
.B \-s
is specified, a call will be made even if there is
no work for that system. This is useful for polling.
.TP 8
.BI \-x debug
Turn on debugging at level
.IR debug .
Level 5 is a good start when trying to find out why a call
failed. Level 9 is very detailed. Level 99 is absurdly verbose.
If
.I role
is 1 (master), output is normally written to the standard message
output
.IR stderr .
If
.I stderr
is unavailable, output is written to
.RI /usr/spool/uucp/AUDIT/ system.
When
.I role
is 0 (slave), debugging output is always written to the AUDIT
file.
.TP 8
.B \-L
Only call ``local'' sites. A site is considered local if
the device-type field in 
.I L.sys
is one of LOCAL, DIR or TCP.
.TP 8
.BI \-t turnaround
Use
.I turnaround
as the line turnaround time (in minutes) instead of the default 30.  If 
.I turnaround
is missing or 0, line turnaround will be disabled.
After
.I uucico
has been running in slave role for
.I turnaround 
minutes, it will attempt to run in master role by negotiating with the
remote machine.
In earlier versions of
.IR uucico ,
a transfer of many large files in one direction would hold up mail
going in the other direction.
With the turnaround code working, the message flow will be more
bidirectional in the short term.
This option only works with newer
.IR uucico 's
and is ignored by older ones.
.PP
If
.I uucico
receives a
.B SIGFPE
(see
.IR kill (1)),
it will toggle the debugging on or off.
.PP
.I Uucpd
is the server for supporting uucp connections over networks.
.I Uucpd
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the ``uucp''
service specification; see \fIservices\fP\|(5).
The server provides login name and password authentication before starting up
.I uucico
for the rest of the transaction.
.PP
.I Uucico
is commonly used either of two ways: as a daemon run periodically by
.IR cron (8)
to call out to remote systems, and as a ``shell'' for remote systems
who call in.
For calling out periodically, a typical line in
.I crontab
would be:
.PP
.nf
	0	*	*	*	*	/usr/sbin/uucico -r1
.fi
.PP
This will run
.I uucico
every hour in master role. 
For each system that has transfer requests queued, 
.I uucico
calls the system, logs in, and executes the transfers. The file
.IR L.sys (5)
is consulted for information about how to log in, while
.IR L-devices (5)
specifies available lines and modems for calling.
.PP
For remote systems to dial in, an entry in the
.IR passwd (5)
file must be created, with a login ``shell'' of
.IR uucico .
For example:
.PP
.nf
	nuucp:Password:6:1::/usr/spool/uucppublic:/usr/sbin/uucico
.fi
.PP
The UID for UUCP remote logins is not critical, so long as it differs from
the UUCP Administrative login.
The latter owns the UUCP files, and assigning
this UID to a remote login would be an extreme security hazard.
