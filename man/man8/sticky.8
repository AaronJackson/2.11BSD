.SH NAME
sticky \- persistent text and append-only directories
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I "sticky bit"
(file mode bit 01000, see
.IR chmod (2))
is used to indicate special treatment
for certain executable files and directories.
.SH "STICKY TEXT EXECUTABLE FILES"
While the `sticky bit'
is set on a sharable executable file,
the text of that file will not be removed from the system swap area.
Thus the file does not have to be fetched from the file system
upon each execution.
Shareable text segments are normally placed
in a least-frequently-used cache after use,
and thus the `sticky bit' has little effect on commonly-used text images.
.PP
Sharable executable files are made by the
.B \-n
and
.B \-z
options of
.IR ld (1).
.PP
Only the super-user can set the sticky bit
on a sharable executable file.
.SH "STICKY DIRECTORIES"
A directory whose `sticky bit' is set
becomes an append-only directory, or, more accurately,
a directory in which the deletion of files is restricted.
A file in a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed
by a user if the user has write permission for the directory and
the user is the owner of the file, the owner of the directory,
or the super-user.
This feature is usefully applied to directories such as /tmp
which must be publicly writable but
should deny users the license to arbitrarily
delete or rename each others' files.
.PP
Any user may create a sticky directory.
See
.IR chmod (1)
for details about modifying file modes.
.SH BUGS
Since the text areas of sticky text executables are stashed in the swap area,
abuse of the feature can cause a system to run out of swap.
.PP
Neither
.IR open (2)
nor
.IR mkdir (2)
will create a file with the sticky bit set.
