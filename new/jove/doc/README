To create the jove manual (as opposed to the man pages)
just do "nroff -ms jove.[12345]" (or ditroff or troff).
That should do the trick.  The man pages will be installed
automatically by "make install" in the previous directory.
And the online/run-time documentation will be installed
automatically, too.
