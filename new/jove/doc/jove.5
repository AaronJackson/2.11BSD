.dc "make-backup-files" "(variable)"
If this variable is set, then whenever \s-2JOVE\s0 writes out a file, it will
move the previous version of the file (if there was one) to "#filename".
This is often convenient if you save a file by accident.  The default
value of this variable is "off".
.IQ Note:
this is an optional part of
\s-2JOVE\s0, and your guru may not have it enabled, so it may not work.
.dc "make-buffer-unmodified" "ESC ~"
This makes \s-2JOVE\s0 think the selected buffer hasn't been changed even if
it has.  Use this when you accidentally change the buffer but don't
want it considered changed.  Watch the mode line to see the * disappear
when you use this command.  
.dc "make-macro-interactive" "Not Bound"
This command is meaningful only while you are defining a keyboard macro,
and when you are in the minibuffer.  Ordinarily, when a command in a macro
definition requires a trailing text argument (file name, search string,
etc.), the argument you supply becomes part of the macro definition.  If
you want to be able to supply a different argument each time the macro is
used, then while you are defining it, you should give the
make-macro-interactive command just before typing the argument which will
be used during the definition process.  Note: you must bind this command
to a key in order to use it; you can't say "ESC X make-macro-interactive".
.dc "mark-threshold" "(variable)"
This variable contains the number of lines point may move by before
the mark is set.  If, in a search or something, point moves by more
than this many lines, the mark is set so that you may return easily.
The default value of this variable is 22 (one screenful, on most
terminals).
.dc "marks-should-float" "(variable)"
When this variable is "off", the position of a mark is remembered as a line
number within the buffer and a character number within the line.  If you add
or delete text before the mark, it will no longer point to the text you
marked originally because that text is no longer at the same line and
character number.  When this variable is "on", the position of a mark is
adjusted to compensate for each insertion and deletion.  This makes marks
much more sensible to use, at the cost of slowing down insertion and
deletion somewhat.  The default value is "on".
.dc "match-regular-expressions" "(variable)"
When set, \s-2JOVE\s0 will match regular expressions in search patterns.
This makes special the characters ., *, [, ], ^, and $, and the two-character
sequences \e<, \e>, \e\|{, \e\|} and \e\||.
See the
.IQ ed(1)
manual page, the tutorial "Advanced Editing in 
.UX
", and the section above "Searching with Regular Expressions"
for more information.
.dc "meta-key" "(variable)"
You should set this variable to "on" if your terminal has a real Meta key.
If your terminal has such a key, then a key sequence like ESC Y can be
entered by holding down Meta and typing Y.  NOTE:  This disables
interrupting noninteractive shell commands.
.dc "mode-line" "(variable)"
The format of the mode line can be determined by setting this variable.
The items in the line are specified using a printf(3) format, with the
special things being marked as "%x".  Digits may be used between the
'%' and the 'x' to mean repeat that many times.
\&'x' may be:
.DS I
.ta .5i 1i 1.5i
	C	check for new mail, and displays "[New mail]" if there
		is any (see also the mail-check-interval and disable-biff
		variables)
	F	the current file name, with leading path stripped
	M	the current list of major and minor modes
	b	the current buffer name
	c	the fill character (-)
	d	the current directory
	e	end of string--this must be the last item in the string
	f	the current file name
	l	the current load average (updated automatically)
	mxy	x, when the buffer is modified or y, when not
	n	the current buffer number
	p	interactive process status for process windows
	s	space, but only if previous character is not a space
	t	the current time (updated automatically)
	w	a '>' for windows which are scrolled left
	[ ]	the square brackets printed when in a recursive edit
	( )	items enclosed in %( ... %) will only be printed on
		the bottom mode line, rather than copied when the
		window is split
.DE
In addition, any other character is simply copied into the mode line.
Characters may be escaped with a backslash.  To get a feel for all
this, try typing "ESC X print mode-line" and compare the result with
your current mode line.
.dc "mode-line-color" "(variable)"
This specifies the color of the modeline (PC version only).  Its default
value is 0, and in that case it is drawn in reverse video.  If it has any
other value, this value is used as the attribute in the Bios calls.
.dc "mode-line-should-standout" "(variable)"
If set, the mode line will be printed in reverse video, if your
terminal supports it.  The default for this variable is "off".
.dc "name-kbd-macro" "Not Bound"
This copies the keyboard macro and gives it a name freeing up the
keyboard macro so you can define some more.  Keyboard macros with
their own names can be bound to keys just like built in commands
can.  See the
.IQ define-macro,
.IQ source
and
.IQ write-macros-to-file
commands.
.dc "newline" "Return"
This divides the current line at point moving all the text to the
right of point down onto the newly created line.  Point moves down to
the beginning of the new line.
.dc "newline-and-backup" "C-O"
This divides the current line at point moving all the text to the
right of point down onto the newly created line.  The difference
between this and "newline" is that point does not move down to the
beginning of the new line.
.dc "newline-and-indent" "LineFeed"
This behaves the same was as Return does when in Auto Indent mode.
This makes Auto Indent mode obsolete but it remains in the name of
backward compatibility.
.dc "next-error" "C-X C-N"
This moves to the next error in the list of errors that were parsed
with
.IQ parse-errors.
In one window the list of errors is shown with the current one always at
the top.  In another window is the file that contains the error.  Point
is positioned in this window on the line where the error occurred.
.dc "next-line" "C-N"
This moves down to the next line.
.dc "next-page" "C-V"
This displays the next page of the buffer by taking the bottom line of
the window and redrawing the window with it at the top.  If there isn't
another page in the buffer \s-2JOVE\s0 rings the bell.  If a numeric argument
is supplied the screen is scrolled up that many lines; if the argument
is negative the screen is scrolled down.
.dc "next-window" "C-X N"
This moves into the next window.  Windows live in a circular list so
when you're in the bottom window and you try to move to the next one
you are moved to the top window.  It is an error to use this command
with only one window.
.dc "number-lines-in-window" "Not Bound"
This displays the line numbers for each line in the buffer being
displayed.  The number isn't actually part of the text; it's just
printed before the actual buffer line is.  To turn this off you run
the command again; it toggles.
.dc "over-write-mode" "Not Bound"
This turns Over Write mode on (or off if it's currently on) in the selected
buffer.  When on, this mode changes the way the self-inserting characters
work.  Instead of inserting themselves and pushing the rest of the line over
to the right, they replace or over-write the existing character.  Also,
Rubout replaces the character before point with a space instead of deleting
it.  When Over Write mode is on "OvrWt" is displayed on the mode line.
.dc "page-next-window" "ESC C-V"
This displays the next page in the next window.  This is exactly the
same as "C-X N C-V C-X P".
.dc "paren-flash" ") } ]"
This handles the C mode curly brace indentation, the Lisp mode paren
indentation, and the Show Match mode paren/curly brace/square bracket
flashing.
.dc "paren-flash-delay" "(variable)"
How long, in tenths of seconds, \s-2JOVE\s0 should pause on a matching
parenthesis in
.IQ Show Match
mode.  The default is 5.
.dc "parse-errors" "Not Bound"
This takes the list of C compilation errors (or output from another program
in the same format) in the current buffer and parses them for use with the
.IQ next-error
and
.IQ previous-error
and
.IQ current-error
commands.
This is a very useful tool and helps with compiling C programs and when used
in conjunction with the "grep" UNIX command very helpful in making changes
to a bunch of files.  This command understands errors produced by cc, cpp,
and lint; plus any other program with the same format (e.g., "grep -n").
\s-2JOVE\s0 visits each file that has an error and remembers each line that
contains an error.  It doesn't matter if later you insert or delete
some lines in the buffers containing errors; \s-2JOVE\s0 remembers where
they are regardless.
.IQ current-error
is automatically executed after one of the parse commands, so you end up
at the first error.  See also
.IQ error-format-string
to make it possible to parse errors of a different format.
.dc "parse-spelling-errors-in-buffer" "Not Bound"
This parses a list of words in the current buffer and looks them up in
another buffer that you specify.  This will probably go away soon.
.dc "pause-jove" "ESC S"
This stops \s-2JOVE\s0 and returns control to the parent shell.  This
only works for users using the C-shell, and on systems that have the
job control facility.  To return to \s-2JOVE\s0 you type "fg" to the C-shell.
.dc "physical-tabstop" "(variable)"
How many spaces your terminal prints when it prints a tab character.
.dc "pop-mark" "Not Bound"
This gets executed when you run
.IQ set-mark
with a numeric argument.
\s-2JOVE\s0 remembers the last 16 marks and you use
.IQ pop-mark
to go
backward through the ring of marks.  If you execute
.IQ pop-mark
enough
times you will eventually get back to where you started.
.dc "popd" "Not Bound"
This pops one entry off the directory stack.  Entries are pushed with
the
.IQ pushd
command.  The names were stolen from the C-shell and the
behavior is the same.
.dc "previous-error" "C-X C-P"
This is the same as
.IQ next-error
except it goes to the previous error.
See
.IQ next-error
for documentation.
.dc "previous-line" "C-P"
This moves up to the previous line.
.dc "previous-page" "ESC V"
This displays the previous page of the current buffer by taking the top
line and redrawing the window with it at the bottom.  If a numeric
argument is supplied the screen is scrolled down that many lines; if
the argument is negative the screen is scrolled up.
.dc "previous-window" "C-X P and C-X O"
This moves into the next window.  Windows live in a circular list so
when you're in the top window and you try to move to the previous one
you are moved to the bottom window.  It is an error to use this command
with only one window.
.dc "print" "Not Bound"
This prints the value of a \s-2JOVE\s0 variable.
.dc "process-bind-to-key" "Not Bound"
This command is identical to bind-to-key, except that it only affects
your bindings when you are in a buffer attached to a process.  When
you enter the process buffer, any keys bound with this command will
automatically take their new values.  When you switch to a non-process
buffer, the old bindings for those keys will be restored.  For example,
you might want to execute
.DS I
process-bind-to-key stop-process ^Z
process-bind-to-key interrupt-process ^C
.DE
Then, when you start up an interactive process and switch into that
buffer, C-Z will execute stop-process and C-C will execute interrupt-
process.  When you switch back to a non-process buffer, C-Z will go
back to executing scroll-up (or whatever you have it bound to).
.dc "process-newline" "Return"
This only gets executed when in a buffer that is attached to an
interactive-process.  \s-2JOVE\s0 does two different things depending on where
you are when you hit Return.  When you're at the end of the I-Process
buffer this does what Return normally does, except it also makes the
line available to the process.  When point is positioned at some other
position that line is copied to the end of the buffer (with the prompt
stripped) and point is moved there with it, so you can then edit that
line before sending it to the process.  This command
.IQ must
be bound
to the key you usually use to enter shell commands (Return), or else
you won't be able to enter any.
.dc "process-prompt" (variable)
What a prompt looks like from the shell and i-shell-command
processes.  The default is "% ", the default C-shell prompt.  This is
actually a regular expression search string.  So you can set it to be
more than one thing at once using the \e| operator.  For instance, for
LISP hackers, the prompt can be
.DS
"% \e|-> \e|<[0-9]>: ".
.DE
.dc "process-send-data-no-return" "Not Bound"
This is like
.IQ process-newline
except it sends everything to the process without the newline.  Normally,
when you type return in a process buffer it sends everything you typed
including the Return.  This command just provides a way to send data to
the process without having to send a newline as well.
.dc "push-shell" "Not Bound"
This spawns a child shell and relinquishes control to it.  This works
on any version of UNIX, but this isn't as good as
.IQ pause-jove
because
it takes time to start up the new shell and you get a brand new
environment every time.  To return to \s-2JOVE\s0 you type "C-D".
.dc "pushd" "Not Bound"
This pushes a directory onto the directory stack and cd's into it.  It
asks for the directory name but if you don't specify one it switches
the top two entries no the stack.  It purposely behaves the same as
C-shell's
.IQ pushd.
.dc "pwd" "Not Bound"
This prints the working directory.
.dc "query-replace-string" "ESC Q"
This replaces the occurrences of a specified string with a specified
replacement string.  When an occurrence is found point is moved to it
and then \s-2JOVE\s0 asks what to do.  The options are:
.DS I
.ta \w'Rubout111'u
Space	to replace this occurrence and go on to the next one.
Period	to replace this occurrence and then stop.
Rubout	to skip this occurrence and go on to the next one.
C-R	to enter a recursive edit.  This lets you temporarily
	suspend the replace, do some editing, and then return
	to continue where you left off.  To continue with the
	Query Replace type "C-X C-C" as if you were trying to
	exit \s-2JOVE\s0.  Normally you would but when you are in a
	recursive edit all it does is exit that recursive
	editing level.
C-W	to delete the matched string and then enter a recursive
	edit.
U	to undo the last replacement.
P or !	to go ahead and replace the remaining occurrences without
	asking.
Return	to stop the Query Replace.
.DE
The search for occurrences starts at point and goes to the end of the
buffer, so to replace in the entire buffer you must first go to the
beginning.
.dc "quit-process" "Not Bound"
This is the same as typing "C-\e" (the Quit character) to a normal UNIX
process, except it sends it to the current process in \s-2JOVE\s0.  This is
only for versions of \s-2JOVE\s0 that have the interactive processes feature.
This only works when you are inside a buffer that's attached to a
process.
.dc "quoted-insert" "C-Q"
This lets you insert characters that normally would be executed as
other \s-2JOVE\s0 commands.  For example, to insert "C-F" you type "C-Q C-F".
.dc "read-word-abbrev-file" "Not Bound"
This reads a specified file that contains a bunch of abbreviation
definitions, and makes those abbreviations available.  If the selected
buffer is not already in Word Abbrev mode this command puts it in
that mode.
.dc "recursive-edit" "Not Bound"
This enters a recursive editing level.  This isn't really very
useful.  I don't know why it's available for public use.  I think I'll
delete it some day.
.dc "redraw-display" "C-L"
This centers the line containing point in the window.  If that line is
already in the middle the window is first cleared and then redrawn.
If a numeric argument is supplied, the line is positioned at that
offset from the top of the window.  For example, "ESC 0 C-L" positions
the line containing point at the top of the window.
.dc "rename-buffer" "Not Bound"
This lets you rename the current buffer.
.dc "replace-in-region" "Not Bound"
This is the same as
.IQ replace-string
except that it is restricted
to occurrences between Point and Mark.
.dc "replace-string" "ESC R"
This replaces all occurrences of a specified string with a specified
replacement string.  This is just like
.IQ query-replace-string
except
it replaces without asking.
.dc "right-margin" "(variable)"
Where the right margin is for
.IQ "Auto Fill"
mode and the
.IQ justify-paragraph
and
.IQ justify-region
commands.  The default is 78.
.dc "right-margin-here" "Not Bound"
This sets the
.IQ right-margin
variable to the current position of
point.  This is an easy way to say, "Make the right margin begin here,"
without having to count the number of spaces over it actually is.
.dc "save-file" "C-X C-S"
This saves the current buffer to the associated file.  This makes your
changes permanent so you should be sure you really want to.  If the
buffer has not been modified
.IQ save-file
refuses to do the save.  If
you really do want to write the file you can use "C-X C-W" which
executes
.IQ write-file.
.dc "scroll-all-lines" "(variable)"
When this is turned on, the entire window will be scrolled left or right
when the current line scrolls.  The default value is OFF, which will
cause \s-2JOVE\s0 to behave in the familiar way, namely to scroll only
the current line.
.dc "scroll-down" "ESC Z"
This scrolls the screen one line down.  If the line containing point
moves past the bottom of the window point is moved up to the center of
the window.  If a numeric argument is supplied that many lines are
scrolled; if the argument is negative the screen is scrolled up
instead.
.dc "scroll-left" "Not Bound"
This scrolls the text in the current window 10 character positions to the
left.  If a numeric argument is specified then the text is scrolled that
number of character positions.  If the variable
.IQ scroll-all-lines
is ON then
.IQ scroll-left
may actually do nothing if the scrolling would cause Point not to be
visible.
.dc "scroll-next-page" "Not Bound"
This continuously scrolls up screen-full lines (PC version only).
.dc "scroll-previous-page" "Not Bound"
This continuously scrolls down screen-full lines (PC version only).
.dc "scroll-right" "Not Bound"
This scrolls the text in the current window 10 character positions to the
right.  If a numeric argument is specified then the text is scrolled that
number of character positions.  If the variable
.IQ scroll-all-lines
is ON then
.IQ scroll-right
may actually do nothing if the scrolling would cause Point not to be
visible.
.dc "scroll-step" "(variable)"
How many lines should be scrolled if the
.IQ previous-line
or
.IQ next-line
commands move you off the top or bottom of the screen.  You may wish to
decrease this variable if you are on a slow terminal.  The default value
is 0, which means to center the current line in the window.  If the value
is negative, the behavior is slightly different.  If you move off the top
of the window, and
.IQ scroll-step
is, say, -5 then the new line will be displayed 5 lines from the bottom
of the window.  If you move off the bottom of the window, the new line
will be positioned 5 lines from the top of the window.
.dc "scroll-up" "C-Z"
This scrolls the screen one line up.  If the line containing point
moves past the top of the window point is moved down to the center of
the window.  If a numeric argument is supplied that many lines are
scrolled; if the argument is negative the screen is scrolled down
instead.
.dc "search-exit-char" "(variable)"
Set this to the character you want to use to exit incremental search.
The default is Newline, which makes i-search compatible with normal
string search.
.dc "search-forward" "C-S"
This searches forward for a specified search string and positions
point at the end of the string if it's found.  If the string is not
found point remains unchanged.  This searches from point to the end of
the buffer, so any matches before point will be missed.
.dc "search-forward-nd" "Not Bound"
This is just like
.IQ search-forward
except that it doesn't assume a default search string, and it doesn't set
the default search string.  This is useful for defining macros, when you
want to search for something, but you don't want it to affect the current
default search string.
.dc "search-reverse" "C-R"
This searches backward for a specified search string and positions
point at the beginning if the string if it's found.  If the string is
not found point remains unchanged.  This searches from point to the
beginning of the buffer, so any matches after point will be missed.
.dc "search-reverse-nd" "Not Bound"
This is just like
.IQ search-reverse
except that it doesn't assume a default search string, and it doesn't set
the default search string.  This is useful for defining macros, when you
want to search for something, but you don't want it to affect the current
default search string.
.dc "select-buffer" "C-X B"
This selects a new or already existing buffer making it the current
one.  You can type either the buffer name or number.  If you type in
the name you need only type the name until it is unambiguous, at which
point typing Escape or Space will complete it for you.  If you want to
create a new buffer you can type Return instead of Space, and a new
empty buffer will be created.
.dc "select-buffer-1" "<Alt>-1"
This selects buffer number 1, if it exists (PC version only).
.dc "select-buffer-2" "<Alt>-2"
This selects buffer number 2, if it exists (PC version only).
.dc "select-buffer-3" "<Alt>-3"
This selects buffer number 3, if it exists (PC version only).
.dc "select-buffer-4" "<Alt>-4"
This selects buffer number 4, if it exists (PC version only).
.dc "select-buffer-5" "<Alt>-5"
This selects buffer number 5, if it exists (PC version only).
.dc "select-buffer-6" "<Alt>-6"
This selects buffer number 6, if it exists (PC version only).
.dc "select-buffer-7" "<Alt>-7"
This selects buffer number 7, if it exists (PC version only).
.dc "select-buffer-8" "<Alt>-8"
This selects buffer number 8, if it exists (PC version only).
.dc "select-buffer-9" "<Alt>-9"
This selects buffer number 9, if it exists (PC version only).
.dc "self-insert" "Most Printing Characters"
This inserts the character that invoked it into the buffer at point.
Initially all but a few of the printing characters are bound to
.IQ self-insert.
.dc "send-typeout-to-buffer" "(variable)"
When this is set \s-2JOVE\s0 will send output that normally overwrites the
screen (temporarily) to a buffer instead.  This affects commands like
.IQ list-buffers,
.IQ list-processes,
and commands that use completion.  The default value is "off".
.dc "set" "Not Bound"
This gives a specified variable a new value.  Occasionally you'll see
lines like "set this variable to that value to do this".  Well, you
use the
.IQ set
command to do that.
.dc "set-mark" "C-@"
This sets the mark at the current position in the buffer.  It prints
the message "Point pushed" on the message line.  It says that instead
of "Mark set" because when you set the mark the previous mark is still
remembered on a ring of 16 marks.  So "Point pushed" means point is
pushed onto the ring of marks and becomes the value of "the mark".
To go through the ring of marks you type "C-U C-@", or execute the
.IQ pop-mark
command.  If you type this enough times you will get back
to where you started.
.dc "shell" "(variable)"
The shell to be used with all the shell commands command.  If your SHELL
environment variable is set, it is used as the value of
.IQ shell;
otherwise "/bin/csh" is the default.
.dc "shell" "Not Bound"
This starts up an interactive shell in a window.  \s-2JOVE\s0 uses
"*shell*" as the name of the buffer in which the interacting takes
place.  See the manual for information on how to use interactive
processes.
.dc "shell-command" "C-X !"
This runs a UNIX command and places the output from that command in a
buffer.  \s-2JOVE\s0 creates a buffer that matches the name of the command
you specify and then attaches that buffer to a window.  So, when you
have only one window running this command will cause \s-2JOVE\s0 to split the
window and attach the new buffer to that window.  Otherwise, \s-2JOVE\s0
finds the most convenient of the available windows and uses that one
instead.  If the buffer already exists it is first emptied, except that if
it's holding a file, not some output from a previous command, \s-2JOVE\s0
prints an error message and refuses to execute the command.  If you
really want to execute the command you should delete that buffer
(saving it first, if you like) or use
.IQ shell-command-to-buffer,
and
try again.
.dc "shell-command-no-buffer" "Not Bound"
This is just like
.IQ shell-command
except it just runs the command without saving the output to any buffer.
It will report the success of the command in the usual way.
.dc "shell-command-to-buffer" "Not Bound"
This is just like
.IQ shell-command
except it lets you specify the
buffer to use instead of \s-2JOVE\s0.
.dc "shell-command-with-typeout" "Not Bound"
This is just like
.IQ shell-command
except that instead of saving the output to a buffer, and displaying
it in a window, this just types out the output in the same way that
.IQ list-buffers
does.  Actually, how this behaves depends on the value of the variable
.IQ send-typeout-to-buffer.
If it is on then shell-command-with-typeout will behave just like
.IQ shell-command.
.dc "shell-flags" "(variable)"
This defines the flags that are passed to shell commands.  The default is
"-c".  See the
.IQ shell
variable to change the default shell.
.dc "show-match-mode" "Not Bound"
This turns on Show Match mode (or off if it's currently on) in the
selected buffer.  This changes "}" and ")" so that when they are typed
the are inserted as usual, and then the cursor flashes back to the
matching "{" or "(" (depending on what was typed) for about half a
second, and then goes back to just after the "}" or ")" that invoked
the command.  This is useful for typing in complicated expressions in
a program.  You can change how long the cursor sits on the matching
paren by setting the "paren-flash-delay" variable in tenths of a
second.  If the matching "{" or "(" isn't visible nothing happens.
.dc "shrink-window" "Not Bound"
This makes the current window one line shorter, if possible.  Windows
must be at least 2 lines high, one for the text and the other for the
mode line.
.dc "source" "Not Bound"
This reads a bunch of \s-2JOVE\s0 commands from a file.  The format of the
file is the same as that in your initialization file (your ".joverc")
in your main directory.  There should be one command per line and it
should be as though you typed "ESC X" while in \s-2JOVE\s0.  For example,
here's part of my initialization file:
.DS I
bind-to-key i-search-reverse ^R
bind-to-key i-search-forward ^S
bind-to-key pause-jove ^[S
.DE
What they do is make "C-R" call the
.IQ i-search-reverse
command and
"C-S" call
.IQ i-search-forward
and "ESC S" call
.IQ pause-jove.
.dc "spell-buffer" "Not Bound"
This runs the current buffer through the UNIX
.IQ spell
program and places
the output in buffer "Spell".  Then \s-2JOVE\s0 lets you edit the list of
words, expecting you to delete the ones that you don't care about, i.e., the
ones you know are spelled correctly.  Then the
.IQ parse-spelling-errors-in-buffer
command comes along and finds all the
misspelled words and sets things up so the error commands work.
.dc "split-current-window" "C-X 2"
This splits the current window into two equal parts (providing the
resulting windows would be big enough) and displays the selected buffer
in both windows.  Use "C-X 1" to go back to 1 window mode.  If a numeric
argument is supplied, the window is split "evenly" that many times (when
possible).
.dc "start-remembering" "C-X ("
This is just another name for the
.IQ begin-kbd-macro
name.  It is included for backward compatibility.
.dc "stop-remembering" "C-X )"
This is just another name for the
.IQ end-kbd-macro
command.  It is included for backward compatibility.
.dc "stop-process" "Not Bound"
This sends a stop signal (C-Z, for most people) to the current process.
It only works if you have the interactive process feature, and you are
in a buffer attached to a process.
.dc "string-length" "Not Bound"
This prints the number of characters in the string that point sits in.
Strings are surrounded by double quotes.  \s-2JOVE\s0 knows that "\e007" is
considered a single character, namely "C-G", and also knows about
other common ones, like "\er" (Return) and "\en" (LineFeed).  This is
mostly useful only for C programmers.
.dc "suspend-jove" "ESC S"
This is a synonym for
.IQ pause-jove.
.dc "sync-frequency" "(variable)"
The temporary files used by \s-2JOVE\s0 are forced out to disk every
.IQ sync-frequency
modifications.  The default is 50, which really makes
good sense.  Unless your system is very unstable, you probably
shouldn't fool with this.
.dc "tag-file" "(variable)"
This the name of the file in which \s-2JOVE\s0 should look up tag
definitions.  The default value is "./tags".
.dc "text-mode" "Not Bound"
This sets the major mode to Text.  Currently the other modes are
Fundamental, C and Lisp mode.
.dc "tmp-file-pathname" "(variable)"
This tells JOVE where to put the tmp files, which is where JOVE stores
buffers internally.  The default is usually in /tmp, but if you want to
store them somewhere else, you can set this variable.  If your system
crashes a lot it might be a good idea to set this variable to somewhere
other than /tmp because the system removes all the files in /tmp upon
reboot, and so you would not be able to recover editor buffers using the
"jove -r" command.

NOTE: In order for this to work correctly you must set this variable
BEFORE JOVE creates the tmp file.  You can set this in your .joverc (the
closer to tbe beginning the better), or as soon as you start up JOVE
before you visit any files.
.dc "transpose-characters" "C-T"
This switches the character before point with the one after point, and
then moves forward one.  This doesn't work at the beginning of the
line, and at the end of the line it switches the two characters before
point.  Since point is moved forward, so that the character that was
before point is still before point, you can use "C-T" to drag a
character down the length of a line.  This command pretty quickly
becomes very useful.
.dc "transpose-lines" "C-X C-T"
This switches the current line with the one above it, and then moves
down one so that the line that was above point is still above point.
This, like
.IQ transpose-characters,
can be used to drag a line down a page.
.dc "unbind-key" "Not Bound"
Use this to unbind
.IQ any
key sequence.  You can use this to unbind even a
prefix command, since this command does not use "key-map completion".  For
example, "ESC X unbind-key ESC [" unbinds the sequence "ESC [".  This is
useful for "turning off" something set in the system-wide ".joverc" file.
.dc "update-time-frequency" "(variable)"
How often the mode line is updated (and thus the time and load
average, if you display them).  The default is 30 seconds.
.dc "use-i/d-char" "(variable)"
If your terminal has insert/delete character capability you can tell \s-2JOVE\s0
not to use it by setting this to "off".  In my opinion it is only worth using
insert/delete character at low baud rates.  WARNING: if you set this to
"on" when your terminal doesn't have insert/delete character capability,
you will get weird (perhaps fatal) results.
.dc "version" "Not Bound"
Displays the version number of this \s-2JOVE\s0.
.dc "visible-bell" "(variable)"
Use the terminal's visible bell instead of beeping.  This is set
automatically if your terminal has the capability.
.dc "visible-spaces-in-window" "Not Bound"
This displays an underscore character instead of each space in the
window and displays a greater-than followed by spaces for each tab
in the window.  The actual text in the buffer is not changed; only
the screen display is affected.  To turn this off you run the command
again; it toggles.
.dc "visit-file" "C-X C-V"
This reads a specified file into the current buffer replacing the old
text.  If the buffer needs saving \s-2JOVE\s0 will offer to save it for you.
Sometimes you use this to start over, say if you make lots of changes
and then change your mind.  If that's the case you don't want \s-2JOVE\s0 to
save your buffer and you answer "NO" to the question.
.dc "window-find" "C-X 4"
This lets you select another buffer in another window three
different ways.  This waits for another character which can be one of
the following:
.DS I
.ta .5i 1i 1.5i
T	Finds a tag in the other window.
F	Finds a file in the other window.
B	Selects a buffer in the other window.
.DE
This is just a convenient short hand for "C-X 2" (or "C-X O" if there are
already two windows) followed by the appropriate sequence for invoking each
command.  With this, though, there isn't the extra overhead of having to
redisplay.  In addition, you don't have to decide whether to type "C-X 2" or
"C-X O" since "C-X 4" does the right thing.
.dc "word-abbrev-mode" "Not Bound"
This turns on Word Abbrev mode (or off if it's currently on) in the
selected buffer.  Word Abbrev mode lets you specify a word (an
abbreviation) and a phrase with which \s-2JOVE\s0 should substitute the
abbreviation.  You can use this to define words to expand into long
phrases, e.g., "jove" can expand into "Jonathan's Own Version of
Emacs"; another common use is defining words that you often misspell
in the same way, e.g., "thier" => "their" or "teh" => "the".  See
the information on the
.IQ auto-case-abbrev
variable.
.sp 1
There are two kinds of abbreviations: mode specific and global.  If you
define a Mode specific abbreviation in C mode, it will expand only in
buffers that are in C mode.  This is so you can have the same
abbreviation expand to different things depending on your context.
Global abbreviations expand regardless of the major mode of the buffer.
The way it works is this: \s-2JOVE\s0 looks first in the mode specific
table, and then in the global table.  Whichever it finds it in first is
the one that's used in the expansion.  If it doesn't find the word it is
left untouched. \s-2JOVE\s0 tries to expand words as they are typed, when
you type a punctuation character or Space or Return.  If you are in Auto
Fill mode the expansion will be filled as if you typed it yourself.
.dc "wrap-search" "(variable)"
If set, searches will "wrap around" the ends of the buffer instead
of stopping at the bottom or top.  The default is "off".
.dc "write-file" "C-X C-W"
This saves the current buffer to a specified file, and then makes that
file the default file name for this buffer.  If you specify a file
that already exists you are asked to confirm over-writing it.
.dc "write-files-on-make" "(variable)"
When set, all modified files will be written out before calling
make when the
.IQ compile-it
command is executed.  The default is "on".
.dc "write-macros-to-file" "Not Bound"
This writes the currently defined macros to a specified file in a format
appropriate for reading them back in with the
.IQ source
command.  The purpose of this command is to allow you to define macros
once and use them in other instances of JOVE.
.dc "write-modified-files" "C-X C-M"
This saves all the buffers that need saving.  If you supply a numeric
argument it asks for each buffer whether you really want to save it.
.dc "write-region" "Not Bound"
This writes the text in the region to a specified file.  If the file
already exists you are asked to confirm over-writing it.
.dc "write-word-abbrev-file" "Not Bound"
This writes the currently defined abbreviations to a specified file.
They can be read back in and automatically defined with
.IQ read-word-abbrev-file.
.dc "yank" "C-Y"
This undoes the last kill command.  That is, it inserts the killed
text at point.  When you do multiple kill commands in a row, they are
merged so that yanking them back with "C\-Y" yanks back all of them.
.dc "yank-pop" "ESC Y"
This yanks back previous killed text.  \s-2JOVE\s0 has a kill ring on which
the last 10 kills are stored.
.IQ yank
yanks a copy of the text at the
front of the ring.  If you want one of the last ten kills you use "ESC
Y" which rotates the ring so another different entry is now at the
front.  You can use "ESC Y" only immediately following a "C-Y" or
another "ESC Y".  If you supply a negative numeric argument the ring
is rotated the other way.  If you use this command enough times in a
row you will eventually get back to where you started.  Experiment
with this.  It's extremely useful.
