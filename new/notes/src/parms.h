 *				the /etc/passwd.  When on, Mstdir is
 *				set to the directory above notes' home.
 *		K_KEY		Defined if you want k and K to be aliases
 *				for q and Q.  It is handy and allows you
 *				to read with one hand.  You can also
 *				get very aggravated when you hit "k" instead
 *				of "j".
 *		BIGTEXT		change from a u_short to a long counter
 *				to allow longer texts...
 *		SYSLOG		define with a syslog(3) facility to write
 *				errors to ``syslogd''.  Currently used only
