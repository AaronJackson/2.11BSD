#	This file contains mappings between notesfiles and newsgroups
#	when coming from news to notes, the file is scanned until
#	a match is found in the second field.  The first field of
#	that line is used as the notesfile name.
#	Similarly, when going from notesfiles to newsgroups, the
#	first line to match the notesfile name with the first field
#	goes to the newsgroup listed in the second field.
#
#	notesfile:newsgroup
#
#	For multiple listings:
#
#	net.games.ches:net.games.chess
#	net.games.ches:net.chess
#
#	net.general:net.general:net.followup
#	net.general:net.followup
#
#	is the setup for the net.general/net.followup issue. This gets
#	newsgroups net.general and net.followup into the notesfile
#	net.general.  The third field of the first line sends 
#	responses from the notesfile net.general to the net.followup
#	newsgroup.  The third field does not take part in mapping from
#	newsgroups to notesfiles; it only works going from notesfiles
#	to newsgroups.
#
# --	N.B.:  net.followup is no fun within notesfiles; it 
# --	destroys the concept of linking responses. We map it here,
# --	violating net etiquette by posting responses in net.general
# --	(this isn't true any more)

#	Resolve newsgroups whose "proper" name is longer than

#	Resolve commonly mis-posted newsgroups.  Send them to the
#	appropriate notesfile.  This includes some newsgroups
#	which have had problems in the past and have 13, 14 and 14+
#	character names floating around.
#	Include mapping notesfile -> "true" newsgroup as first line
#	to route outgoing notes correctly.
