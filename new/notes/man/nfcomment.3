.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nfcomment 
provides user programs with the ability to insert notes
into a
notesfile.
.PP
The note is inserted into the notesfile specified by 
.I "nfname."
.I Text
is the address of the body of the note; this must be null-terminated.
If
.I text
is  NULL,
the note is gathered from standard input until an EOF is encountered.

.I title
parameter.

director message is enabled
or
the note is entered anonymously.
These take effect only if the user has the appropriate priviledges
in the notesfile.
