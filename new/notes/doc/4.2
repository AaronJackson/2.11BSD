.se "Piped Insertion of Notes"

	The nfpipe program enters text from the standard input into a
notesfile:

	nfpipe topic [-t title] [ -d ] [ -a ]

The -t option allows specification of a title.  The -d and -a options
specify the director and anonymous flags respectively (if available).
If no title is specified, one is manufactured from the first line
of the note.
