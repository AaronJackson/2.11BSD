	A number of people have been very helpful in bringing
the notesfile syste to its current state.
Rob Kolstad first brought up the idea of implementing notesfiles
on UNIX.
Malcolm Slaney and Brian Redman 
both used the program before it was close to being ready and
offered numerous suggestions and corrections.
Lou Salkind and Rick Spickelmier
put much effort into
generalizing the command parsing and adding
features I've forgotten to mention.
Tw Cook first implemented USENET-compatible headers for
the notesfile/news gateway.

	To all of these people, I give my hearty thanks for helping
to make this system what it is:
a convenient tool for
user communications,
personal notebooks,
project workbooks,
and 
discussion management.
