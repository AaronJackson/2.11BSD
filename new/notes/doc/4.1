.se "Hard Copy Output"

	The program ``nfprint'' sends to standard output a nicely formatted listing of
the notesfile in its command line.
Its format is:

	nfprint [-lnn] [-p] [-t] topic [ note# ] [ note#-note# ] [ ... ]

The ``-l'' option specifies an alternate page size (the default is
66).
The optional note number list specifies that only
certain notes of the notesfile
are to be printed.  The list can specify individual notes and ranges.
The notes are printed in the order specified.

	The -p option specifies that each notestring is to begin
on a new page.
The -t option signifies that only a table of contents is to be
generated.
