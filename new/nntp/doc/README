[A README file for a doc directory?  Yow...]

Manual pages are in the *.dst files.  Because some manual pages contain
site-dependent things (e.g., path name references for the news lib
directory, etc.), you should customize the file "config.sh".

Once you've done that (look at config.sh -- it's self explanatory),
type "make".

The RFC describing the protocol is in "rfc977".
