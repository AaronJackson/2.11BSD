     The program "nntpxmit" is an active trnamission client
(see the comment in nntpxmit.c for a description of the
difference between active and passive clients) written by Erik Fair
<fair@ucbvax.berkeley.edu, ...!ucbvax!fair>.  A larger comment on
its inner workings can be found by looking at nntpxmit.c

     To use nntpxmit, you should edit your news sys file to have
an entry like this:

#
# NASA Ames Research Center
#
nike:ucb,uc,mod,to.nike:F:/usr/spool/news/batch/ames-titan.arpa

This will place names of news articles in the ucb, uc, and mod newsgroups
in the file "/usr/spool/news/batch/ames-titan.arpa".  This is because
we assume the output batch file will be the machine's internet name.

Periodically, you should have crontab run "nntpsend" to transmit
the news.  A good choice for "periodically" is every 10 minutes.
nntpsend depends on the program "shlock", which make should have
made already.  Also, nntpsend will need to be customized for your system.
Fortunately, it's pretty straightforward.

     nntpxmit has an option "-s" which *supresses* statistic
logging via syslog.  Additionally, the "-d" option is availible
for debugging.

     [My thanks extended to Erik for writing nntpxmit, shlock,
and the stats scripts.  My thanks also to Mel Pleasant
<pleasant@topaz.rutgers.edu> for the nntpsend script.  --Phil]
