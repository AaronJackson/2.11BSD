     This directory contains lotsa good stuff common to both
the news server, support, and client programs.  The short of it is:

conf.h		Configuration information for NNTP server,
		support, and client programs.  Described in detail
		in README in this directory.

nntp.h		These are the #define's of the numeric response
		codes (and other stuff) in NNTP as defined by RFC 977.

clientlib.c	This file is a collection of routines which clients
		can use to talk to the NNTP server.  The code is
		well documented, but briefly, the functions are

			getserverbyfile	Opens a named file and
					returns the contents,
					presumed to be a host name
			server_init	Open connection to server
			getsocket	Get a stream socket
			get_server	Get line from server
			put_server	Send line to server
			close_server	Close connection

		It is worth noting that these routines use
		buffered I/O, and leave the external variables
		"ser_rd_fp" and "ser_wr_fp" (server read/write
		file pointers, respectively) floating around
		for use by programs which need them.

If you use the clientlib package to build an NNTP client of your
own, you either need to define NNTPSRC on the "cc" command
line when compiling clientlib.c, or add compile-type -D lines to
the "cc" command line for each option.  Defining NNTPSRC will
try to include "../common/conf.h", which should be used if it exists.
