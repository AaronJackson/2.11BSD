This differs from the standard old l11 in several ways:

1.	A global absolute symbol may be defined several times, if it
	has the same value.
2.	If a psect is declared with differing attributes, the first
	declaration is believed.

	Both of the above generate warning messages.


3.	The listing shows the psect attributes.

4.	l11 does not expect a local symbol table.  Hence the 'rsx-11d'
	.enabl reg feature will not make the loader croak.
