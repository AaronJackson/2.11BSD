This progam reads a VMS backuptape.

The tape program is orginally written by John Douglas Carey and
the pattern matching routine by some unknown on the net. 

The remote tape option use the rmtlib from mod.sources.

A good way to archive remotetape access for users with only
a local account is to create a "netwide" user tar and let
the remote tape programs do suid to user tar.

The program is tested on vax and sun.
