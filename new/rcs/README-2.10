This version of RCS has been compiled and tested on 2.10; it is believed to
work correctly.  However, because of memory limitations it runs very slowly.
If you are willing to find ways to reduce the memory requirements of this
version of RCS you may choose to run it.  Please send the changes in to us.
Remember that the new revision 4 RCS files won't work correctly
with version 3 of RCS.
