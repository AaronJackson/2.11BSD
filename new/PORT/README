The individuals responsible for the software should be identified in
the accompanying 4.3BSD documents which describe the user contributed
software.  All software included here has been written by outside
parties; we gratefully acknowledge their contributions.

Consult ``Installing and Operating 4.3BSD on the VAX'' (SMM:1) for
instructions on how to extract the user contributed software.
The organization of the software is such that a single make command
will compile and/or install most of it. Some of the software requires
customization before it can be built and installed. The software
requiring customization is listed in the top level Makefile in OPTDIR.
To compile everything else, simply type

	make

Once this is done, to install the default software in the /usr/new
area of the file system type

	make installall

to install only the subset of software installed on the distribution
tape type

	make install

Most subdirectories have README files and individual Makefiles.  If
you want only some of the software contained here go to the appropriate
directories and use the ``make'' and ``make install'' commands to compile
and install the desired system.  As distributed, all the default software
is set up to be installed in ${DESTDIR}/usr/new, where DESTDIR is a make
macro that can be supplied on the command line.  Consult each directory's
README file for the information needed to change this.

The software included here is in use at Berkeley, or other sites
running 4.3BSD (or an earlier derivative). Please remember that this is
contributed software and, as such, we do not ``support'' it in the same
manner as that software which is part of the standard distribution.
Most subsystems have either a README file or doc directory that
should be consulted to find an interested party to which bugs and/or
bug fixes should be sent. In certain cases these people are located at
Berkeley; this does not imply they are part of the Computer Systems
Research Group, please contact them as individuals.
