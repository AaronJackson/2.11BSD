@(#)README	3.2 1996/11/29

Please send comments or information to
	seismo!elsie!tz
for forwarding to folks interested in time zone matters.

Be sure to read the comments in "Makefile" and make any changes
needed to make things right for your system.

This version of the time zone software uses a new format
(based on the work of Guy Harris, a.k.a guy@sun.UUCP)
for the time zone information files.  They are stored in a
directory named "/usr/share/zoneinfo".
If you've already compiled programs with older time zone software,
you may need to make a copy of /usr/share/zoneinfo to the old location.

For better compatability with other versions of time conversion functions,
the time zone abbreviation to be used with localtime's return value is now
pointed to by one of the two elements of the (char *) array tzname, rather
than by the (char *) tz_abbr.  If you have code that uses tz_abbr, add a
	-DTZA_COMPAT
to the end of the
	CFLAGS=
line in "Makefile".

To use the new functions, use a "-lz" option when compiling or linking.

Historical local time information has been included here not because it
is particularly useful, but rather to:

*	give an idea of the variety of local time rules that have
	existed in the past and thus an idea of the variety that may be
	expected in the future;

*	provide a test of the generality of the local time rule description
	system.

The information in the time zone data files is by no means authoritative;
if you know that the rules are different from those in a file, by all means
feel free to change file (and please send the changed version to seismo!elsie!tz
for use in the future).  Europeans take note!
