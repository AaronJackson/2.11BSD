		More Movement - Words and Sentences

   Actually, vi knows about much more than just characters and lines in 
files.  It has a concept of words and sentences.  Vi defines a word in one
of two ways:
	1) Letters, digits and '_' surrounded by spaces or punctuation
	2) Any characters at all, surrounded by spaces

   Both definitions have their uses and vi has two parallel sets of commands
for dealing with them.  In the list below, the lower-case commands use the
first definition and the upper-case ones use the second one.

	w  W = Move the cursor forward one word.
	b  B = Move the cursor backward one word.
	e  E = Move the cursor to the end of the current word or, if already
		there, to the end of the next word forward.

   For sentences, vi uses ')' to move forward one sentence and '(' to move
backward one sentence.

   Type 'ready' now to try out the word and sentence commands.
