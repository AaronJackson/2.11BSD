To do the lessons on 'vi', I need to know your terminal type, and your terminal
must have an "addressable cursor".  You can still use 'vi' (in something
called "open mode") on other kinds of terminals, but not with these lessons.

I will put you out of learn.  Find out the terminal type for the
terminal you are using (this may mean asking someone), then type

setenv TERM xxx
tset

where you replace xxx with your terminal type.

Some common types are:	TERMINAL MODEL		TERMINAL TYPE
			Televideo 912/920C	tvi920c
			Televideo 925		tvi925
			LSI adm3a		adm3a
			Zenith/Heathkit H19	h19
			Datamedia 1520		dm1520

When you are done type "learn vi" again.
