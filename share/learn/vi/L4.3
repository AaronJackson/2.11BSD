		More Movement - Searching in the File

   The last, but certainly not least, method we'll look at for moving around
in the file is searching.  The command to search for a particular word or
phrase or whatever is '/'.  When you type a /, vi will move the cursor to 
the bottom of the screen, echo the / and wait.  You then type in the text
you want to search for and hit return.  If the text exists anywhere in the
file, vi will move the cursor forward to the next occurence.  If it gets
to the end of the file without finding it, vi will wrap around to the front
of the file and continue searching.

   If you want vi to start searching in the backward direction, i.e, toward
the beginning of the file, use ? instead of /.  Note that ? is just a shifted
/ on most terminals.

   To repeat a previous search with the same text, just hit 'n', for 'next'.
To repeat the search in the opposite direction, hit 'N'.

   Type 'ready' now to try out the search commands.
#user
#create Search
   Searching uses these commands:

	/ = To search forward for some text
	? = To search backward for some text
	n = To repeat the previous search (i.e. go on to the 'next' occurance)
	N = To repeat the previous search but in the opposite direction

   We'll see later how to specify a pattern to search for, rather than
just straight text.  This will make a lot of searches much easier.

   Oftentimes, you will do a search and then want to go back to where you
were previously.  The '' command (that's two single quotes) will move you
back to the last place you were.  This is a special case of a command we'll
look at in more detail later, in the section on marking.
