		    Basic Movement - File movements

   Now you'd probably like to be able to move around in files which are
longer than one page, eh?  You could probably look through the whole thing
using '-' and return to go up and down a line at a time, but...

   The ^D and ^U commands are used for moving by half-pages. (Remember, ^D
means hitting the D key while holding down the 'Control' button...).  ^D will
move the screen down a half-page in the file.  ^U, oddly enough, does the
reverse, moving you up a half-page.

   If you're in more of a hurry, try ^F and ^B, which move you forward and
backward a full page at a time, respectively.

   If you know exactly which line you want to go to (i.e. you know its line
number) then the 'G' command was made for you.  You just type the line
number followed by a 'G' and vi will 'go' to that line.  If you type 'G'
without a preceding number, vi will go to the end of the file.  Here's a
little trick:  if you want to see line numbers in vi type ':set nu'.

   Type 'ready' now to get practice in moving in larger files.

   The commands for moving around in larger files are as follows:

	^D - Scroll forward (down) a half-screen
	^U - Scroll backward (up) a half-screen
	^F - Page forward one full screen
	^B - Page backward one full screen
	 G - Go to a particular line.  56G goes to line
	     56.  G goes to the end of the file.

future lessons.  You'll get a new copy of it each time, so don't worry about
accidentally messing it up.
