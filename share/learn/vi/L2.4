These are the commands we've covered so far.  Do you remember them all?

		 Escape = Make vi listen
	       ^L or ^R = Redraw the screen
		     :q = Quit
	        :w  :wq = Save your changes (:wq also quits)
	    '-'  return = Move up and down a line
       space  backspace = Move forward and backward a character
arrow-keys (or h j k l) = Move left, down, up, and right (respectively)
		^  $  0 = Move to beginning and end of a line
		H  M  L = Move to top, middle, and bottom of screen
		 ^D  ^U = Scroll down and up a half screen
		 ^F  ^B = Move forward and backward a full screen
		      G = Go to a particular line

Type 'ready' to go into vi and refresh your memory.  If you remember it all,
you don't have to practice very long.
