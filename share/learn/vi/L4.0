		The First Stopping Point

   It would be understandable if, at this point, you were feeling a little
dazed about all of the commands you've learned.  If so, here is a good place
to take a rest.  You might consider stopping the tutorial at this point
and using what you know in day-to-day practice for a while.  When you're
ready to go on and learn some more, you should use the command
	
			learn vi 4.0

which will let the learn program know where you left off.

   If you want to stop here, just type 'bye'.  If you want to go on and learn
about Intermediate Movement and Searching, just type 'ready'.
