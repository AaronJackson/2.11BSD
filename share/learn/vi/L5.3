		Move Alteration - Shifting

   Often, especially when editing programs, it would be handy to be able
to shift parts of the file over some number of spaces to the right or left.
Vi provides the '>' and '<' commands for this.  They move lines in the 
obvious directions eight spaces at a time.  They can take targets, like the
'd', 'c', and 'y' commands, but usually you'll only want to use those which
affect lines (e.g. not 'w' or ')'); the others all work, but probably aren't
frequently useful.

   Of course, if you double the commands (i.e. '>>' and '<<'), they refer to
single lines.

   If you'd prefer them to shift text by some amount other than 8 spaces, you
can set an option to that effect:
		:set shiftwidth=n
where 'n' is the number of spaces you want them to shift.  The word shiftwidth
can be abbreviated sw.

   Type 'ready' to try out these commands.
#user
#create Shift
  The shift commands:

		     >  = Shift text right shiftwidth spaces (default 8)
		     <  = Shift text left shiftwidth spaces
    :set sw=n
       or  		= Change the value of shiftwidth to n
    :set shiftwidth=n


   The :set command has many different options which can be set and changed.
We'll go over a list of them in a later lesson.
