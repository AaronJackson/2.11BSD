   You've now completed that part of vi which might be used every day.
There are a fair number of other sets of features which make certain
jobs easier, but you know all of the common commands.

   This concludes the Vi learn sequence.  The recommendation at this
point is that you get used to using vi on a regular basis.  After
you're accustomed to working in the editor and feel quite comfortable
with it, get a copy of the reference manual for vi, called
"An Introduction to Display Editing with Vi".
There are a number of features described there which make specific
types of editing jobs much easier.  A little reading will probably
give a large yield in your productivity and satisfaction.  Good Luck!

   Type 'ready' now to finish this sequence.
