.TH CHFLAGS 1 "November 28, 1994"
.UC 4
.SH NAME
chflags \- change file flags
.SH SYNOPSIS
chflags [-R] [-f]\fBflags\fP \fBfile\fP ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B chflags
utility modifies the file flags of the listed files
as specified by the
.B flags
operand.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 15
-R
Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted
in the files instead of just the files themselves.
.PP
-f
\fBchflags\fP will not complain if it fails to change the flags on a 
file.
.PP
Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.
The following keywords are currently defined:
.TP 20
arch
No effect.  This bit is defined and will be set/cleared as requested but
nothing in the system makes use of it yet.
.TP 20
dump
Set the dump flag
.TP 20
sappnd
Set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
.TP 20
schg
Set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
.TP 20
uappnd
Set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
.TP 20
uchg
Set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)
.PP
Putting the letters
.B no
before an option causes the flag to be turned off.
For example:
.TP 20
nodump
the file should never be dumped
.PP
Symbolic links do not have flags and are silently ignored by
.B chflags.
When the -R option is given and symbolic links are encountered they are
not traversed.  This is the same behaviour as \fBchmod(1)\fP.
.PP
The
.B chflags
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
