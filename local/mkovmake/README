 
 Mkovmake is an optimizing overlay makefile generator--
 in other words, you use it in the Makefile of a large
 program that you are trying to make, and it generates
 base and overlay definitions and an ld command that
 would correctly load the object modules.  This avoids
 incessant calculations of module sizes each time sources
 are changed, and allows large programs to be easily put
 together on a PDP-11.  It is designed to allow varying
 levels of user participation in case the user can 
 optimize better than mkovmake's static algorithm.
 
 Try it out; the man page even has examples.
