DDD     DOUBLE-SPEED DATA DUMPER

Ddd is a stripped-down enhanced-throughput multi-process dd(1) clone.

This is version 2.  It has some bugs fixed.  The code is also cleaner
and more portable.  Forget about version 1 and destroy all copies of it.
(version 1 is the set of files _without_ version numbers...)

See man page and source for details.

FUTURE PROJECETS:
Implement skip, files, count and seek opitions,
as well as noerror and swab conversions.
Support for multivolume files - replace bundle(1).
