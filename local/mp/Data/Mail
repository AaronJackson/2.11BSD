The Rich Burridge Archive Server has received your request.
All of the files that you asked for are in the database.
Your request is 66314 bytes. It has been placed in the mailer's work
queue. The work queue is periodically processed by the archive mailer, which
always sends the shortest queued request first. The length of time that it
takes to receive your request will depend on how many smaller requests are in
front of it in line.
