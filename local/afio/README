Afio is a better way of dealing with cpio-format archives. It is
generally faster than cpio, provides more diverse magnetic tape
options and deals somewhat gracefully with input data corruption.

Afio is quite portable. It is now running under 4.2BSD, System V
and even one or two UNIX-like operating systems. Please see the
beginning of afio.c for a brief description of the compile-time
configuration options.

Discussion of features (including those unintended ones commonly
referred to as "bugs") may be sent to ..!{ihnp4, sun}!laidbak!mdb.
