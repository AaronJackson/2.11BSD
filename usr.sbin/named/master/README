How to add new hosts to the name server data base:

1) Edit 'named.hosts' file:

	For each machine you need to enter the following information:
	machine name, all its network addresses, host information, and common
	aliases for it.  The WKS records list well-known-services; they are
	optional.

	This is the entry for calder.

CALDER		IN	A	128.32.130.1
		IN	A	128.32.129.3
		IN	WKS	128.32.0.12	TCP TELNET FTP SMTP ECHO DOMAIN FINGER
		IN	WKS	128.32.0.12	UDP ECHO TIME TFTP
		IN	HINFO	VAX-11/750 UNIX
UCBCALDER	IN	CNAME	CALDER

 For the machine you are adding:
	1) replace 'CALDER' with the new machine name
	2) replace '128.32.130.1' with the new machines address
		if there is more then one address for the machine
		then add lines like the one with '128.32.129.3'
	3) replace 'VAX-11/750' with the machine type
	4) If it doesn't run 'UNIX' then replace UNIX with its operating system.

2) Edit 'named.rev' file:

	For each address of a machine you need to enter the reverse
	address notation for the machine:

	For calder the lines look as follows:

12.0	IN	PTR	CALDER.BERKELEY.EDU.
3.129	IN	PTR	CALDER.BERKELEY.EDU.

	Calder has two address '128.32.0.12' and '128.32.129.3'

	You take the two numbers after 128.32 and reverse them.
	Then replace CALDER with the new machine name.

   *** Note the "." on "EDU." it needs to be there. ***

3) Increment the serial number on both files.  If you use sccs or rcs,
arrange for this to happen automatically when changes are checked in.
