.SH NAME
edquota \- edit user quotas
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B edquota
[
.B \-p
.I proto-user
]
.IR users ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Edquota
is a quota editor.  One or more users
may be specified on the command line.
For each user a temporary file is created
with an ASCII representation of the current
disc quotas for that user and an editor is
then invoked on the file.  The quotas may then
be modified, new quotas added, etc.  Upon
leaving the editor,
.I edquota
reads the temporary file and modifies the binary
quota files to reflect the changes made.
.PP
If the 
.B \-p
option is specified,
.I edquota
will duplicate the quotas of the prototypical user
specified for each user specified.  This is the normal
mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups
of users.
.PP
The editor invoked is 
.IR vi (1)
unless the environment variable EDITOR specifies otherwise.
.PP
Only the super-user may edit quotas.
