.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sa
reports on, cleans up, and generally maintains accounting files.
.PP
.I Sa
is able to condense the information in
.I /usr/adm/acct
into a summary file
.I /usr/adm/savacct
which contains a count of the
number of times each command was called and the time resources consumed.
This condensation is desirable because on a large system
.I /usr/adm/acct
can grow by 100 blocks per day.
The summary file is normally read before the accounting file,
so the reports include all available information.
.PP
If a file name is given as the last argument, that file will be treated
as the accounting file;
.I /usr/adm/acct
is the default.
.PP
Output fields are labeled: \*(lqcpu\*(rq for the sum of user+system time
(in minutes), \*(lqre\*(rq for real time (also in minutes),
\*(lqk\*(rq for cpu-time averaged core usage (in 1k units),
\*(lqavio\*(rq for average number of i/o operations per execution.
With options fields labeled \*(lqtio\*(rq for total i/o operations,
\*(lqk*sec\*(rq for cpu storage integral (kilo-core seconds), \*(lqu\*(rq and \*(lqs\*(rq
for user and system cpu time alone (both in minutes) will sometimes appear.
.PP
There are near a googol of options:
.PP
.TP
a
Print all command names, even those containing unprintable characters
and those used only once.  By default, those are placed under the
name `***other.'
.TP
b
Sort output by sum of user and system time divided by number of calls.
Default sort is by sum of user and system times.
.TP
c
Besides total user, system, and real time for each command print percentage
of total time over all commands.
.TP
d
Sort by average number of disk i/o operations.
.TP
D
Print and sort by total number of disk i/o operations.
.TP
f
Force no interactive threshold compression with \-v flag.
.TP
i
Don't read in summary file.
.TP
j
Instead of total minutes time for each category, give seconds per call.
.TP
k
Sort by cpu-time average memory usage.
.TP
K
Print and sort by cpu-storage integral.
.TP
l
Separate system and user time; normally they are combined.
.TP
m
Print number of processes and number of CPU minutes for each user.
.TP
n
Sort by number of calls.
.TP
r
Reverse order of sort.
.TP
s
Merge accounting file into summary file
.I /usr/adm/savacct
when done.
.TP
t
For each command report ratio of real time to the sum of user and system times.
.TP
u
Superseding all other flags, print for each command in the accounting file the
user ID and command name.
.TP
v
Followed by a number
.I n,
types the name of each command used
.I n
times or fewer.
Await a reply from the terminal; if it begins with `y', add the command to
the category `**junk**.' This is used to strip out garbage.
.TP
S
The following filename is used as the command summary file instead of
.I /usr/adm/savacct.
.TP
U
The following filename is used instead of
.I /usr/adm/usracct
to accumulate the per-user statistics printed by the \-m option.

The number of options to this program is absurd.
