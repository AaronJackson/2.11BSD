.SH NAME
pstat \- print system facts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/sbin/pstat
.B \-aixptufT
[
.B suboptions
] [
.B system
] [
.B corefile

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pstat
interprets the contents of certain system tables.
If
.I corefile
is given, the tables are sought there, otherwise
in
.I /dev/kmem.
The required namelist is taken from
.I /vmunix
unless 
.I system
is specified.
Options are
.TP \w'WCHAN\ 'u
.B \-a
Under
.BR \-p ,
describe all process slots rather than just active ones.

the next argument is its address as given
by

The process must be in main memory, or the file used can
be a core image and the address 0.
Only the fields located in the first page cluster can be located
succesfully if the process is in main memory.

.PD
.PP
.B \-s
print information about swap space usage: the number of (1k byte) pages used
and free is given as well as the number of used pages which belong
to text images.
.PP
.B \-T
prints the number of used and free slots in the several system tables
and is useful for checking to see how full system tables have become if the
system is under heavy load.

.SH BUGS
It would be very useful if the system recorded \*(lqmaximum occupancy\*(rq
on the tables reported by
.B \-T;
even more useful if these tables were dynamically allocated.
