COMMENTS:

This is the second stab at a small library to interface to the Ident
protocol server. Maybe this will work correctly on some machines.. :-)
 
The ident-tester.c file is a small daemon (to be started from Inetd)
that does an ident lookup on you if you telnet into it. Can be used
to verify that your Ident server is working correctly.
 
I'm currently running this "ident-tester" on port 114 at lysator.liu.se
(130.236.254.1) if you wish to test your server.

This library now contains some higher-level routines, as well as a
similar test program to test these (lookup-tester).

/Pär Emanuelsson <pell@lysator.liu.se>, 4 April 1993


Support for NextStep 3.1 added.

/Michael Kuch <kuch@mailserv.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de>, 13 Aug 1993


Updated the ident.h header file to work with Linux, and reorganized the
Makefile for easier compilation...

For release 0.18:

Added some bug fixes and improvements from Jean-Philippe Martin-Flatin
(syj@ecmwf.int).

/Peter Eriksson, 5 Oct 1995


For release 0.20:

Some cleanup of the distribution, and some bug fixes in the
ident-tester.c source. Perhaps it should be called 1.0? (Perhaps
it should use GNU Autoconf...)
