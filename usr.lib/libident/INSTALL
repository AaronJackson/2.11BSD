To build the libident library for a supported target, just type:

	make <target>

where target can be one of:

	sunos5, sunos4, svr4, bsd, linux, nextstep3.0 or nextstep3.1

For other systems you'll need to hack the Makefile (please do send
me any patches you make so I can include them into the next version!)
