.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B umount
command
calls the
umount(2)
system call to remove a
.I "special device"
from the file system tree at the point
.IR node .
If either

are not provided, the appropriate information is taken from the
fstab(5)
file.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.sp
.TP 10
.B \-a
All of the file systems described in
fstab(5)
are unmounted.
.TP 10
.B \-f
The file system is forcibly unmounted.
Active special devices continue to work,
but all other files return errors if further accesses are attempted.
The root file system cannot be forcibly unmounted.
This is not currently implemented in 2.11BSD.
.TP 10
\fB\-t\fP \fIufs\fP | \fIexternal type\fP
