.SH NAME
nmcoll \- find name collisions in object files (2BSD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nmcoll
file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nmcoll
scans a set of object files as produced by the assembler (typically ending with
.IR .o )
and produces a listing of suspicious name duplications.
.I Nmcoll
is useful when porting programs that were developed with compilers that support
flex (long) names to 2.11BSD which only supports seven significant characters
in external names.
.SH NOTES
.I Nmcoll
is a carryover from the era before longer symbol names were supported in
object files.
