xe.c	a working driver for the DTC-11 Q-bus/SCSI interface card that
	drives a Xebec 1410 card.  It supports different drive sizes on
	a single Xebec card and (partially) partial-block transfers.
	See the code for details on how to set up the parameters for
	your drive.

xereg.h	this is /usr/include/sys/xereg.h.  Register definitions for the
	xe driver

xeuboot.s	a boot block for use with the DTC-11 -- Xebec S1410 pair.
	It too is device dependent and needs to be modified to suit your
	drive

xestand.c	a standalone version of the driver.  It, as well, is
	device dependent and must be edited to fit your drives.
