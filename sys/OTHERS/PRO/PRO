Actually, to be honest, it was Rick Macklem at the University of
Guelph who did all the work for PRO350s.  We've just added
support for PRO380 which was essentially trivial after his work
(and after remembering that the 380 and 350s had a device in
different places).

The baseline used looks like the standard 2.9 distribution - it
wasn't the harvard distribution.  I've been meaning to try this
out, but since our only 11s are PROs with 10MB hard disks...

The modifications were minimial.  Mostly changes to deal with
the PRO's specialized clock and interrupt chip.  The big thing
that was added at Guelph was all the device drivers: cn.c
(console - bitmap display/keyboard), r5.c (rx50 controller),
rd.c (rd5x controller), pc.c (comm port & lp port driver), and
recently if_dc.c (the decna controller).  All the above drivers
are for CTI bus devices.  (He also included an RDQX1 controller
for QBUS machines which he said might work on UDA conrollers as
well - probably should too since both are MSCP).

The PRO350 essentially maps to an 11/23 while the PRO380
essentially maps to an 11/73 w/o cache or unibus map (not sure
if the Micro-11/73 has a unibus map).  The PRO380 pretends to
have a cache.

CTI modules with drivers:
	RX50 controller
	RD50/RD51 controller
	DECNA ethernet adapter
	Screen/keyboard controller (n.b. part of the system unit on a 380)
	Memory boards (configured in by PRO diagnostics)

Devices with no drivers:
1	Phone system controller (TCMS board?)
*	4-line SLU adapter (probably easy, but neither of us have one)
2	RD52/RD51/RD50 controller
3	CPM card
*	Real Time Interface card

* - no documentation and no card to test it with 
1 - no card to test with and insufficent documentation 
2 - I'm pretty sure that the RD52 (or 53) require a different
controller than the ones which most people have for their
RD51/RD50's.  However, with minor modifications to the current
driver, should work
3 - we have a card to test it with and some documenation, but it
isn't high priority

Problems with currently running software:
	console driver isn't as robust as it could be.  Someone
	here is working on it.

	comm port driver isn't as effective as it might be.
	We're looking at that as well.

	decna driver is in beta test.  No problems to date,
	though there might be problems with breaking out of a
	controller hung condition

	clock interrupts get lost sometimes...

	system isn't autoconfigured (well a couple of devices
	are), assumptions are made about where the major cards
	are in the CTI bus (relates to interrupt structure and
	device addresses).  Unfortunately, DEC started out
	making it easy to do this and then dropped support for
	it (they had device ids in some of the earlier cards).
	This is something people will have to live with...

Modules modified: conf/l.s, conf/ioconf.c, conf/c.c for the
device drivers.  The changes to the sys directory I'm sending in
the next message so you can get a feel for what needed to
happen.  (All changes in the sys directory which apply to the
PRO350 also apply to the PRO380).  Rick mapped the 350 as machine
type "21" (it does require slightly different handling) and I
mapped the 380 as type "71" (to follow suit - was going to pick
83, but that would have been a horrible idea).  Modifications
for the 380 also included going through and making sure that
conditions for the 70 got mapped for the 380.

I guess I could give you a temporary account on our machine so
you can get the stuff.  However, I've got to clean up some
first, you can poke around if you want.

Rick, do you have any problems with giving the code to
Harvard/Seismo so they can distribute it?  They check licensing.

Charlie
