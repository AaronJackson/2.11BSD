Not sure if we should put this in -- maybe as part of the man page
for the dh?  Or a README?  Your choice...

Also when we installed 2.10 we had a problem with port-boards because of a
slight difference between Emulex CS-02 boards in DH-11/DM-11 emulation and
the real thing. The rules for 22-bit QBUS operation are different. Anyway at
the time we fixed the problem locally and since we were not on the net
reliably I don't think we told anybody. In case the problem still remains
unfixed I include patches for 2.10 for the problem. You can then post a fix
to news if necessary.

I am just back from holidays and this message arrived today. It seems that
this message arrived was delayed in IRLEARN.BITNET (a site in another
irish university) for 3 weeks. None of your other
messages have yet arrived. Normally the through-time by this link is less
than an hour. Hopefully mail to ajudge@maths.tcd.ie should only take a matter
of hours from the states. Something must have gone  wrong while I was
away.

The manual for the CS02/H1 says that the board can emulate either one
DH11/DM11 or 2 DHV11's. This and the programming section seems to imply that
there is a DEC product. Unfortunately I don't know for sure. The Emulex board
may be emulating the DH on some other bus. However the DEC product probably
does not support 22-bit addressing as Emulex use part of the LSR (line status
register for this). The patches ARE specific to 22-bit addressing on a Q-BUS,
they may be specific to Emulex if DEC does have a 22-bit Q-BUS DH.
