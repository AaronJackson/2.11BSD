.SH NAME
lock \- reserve a terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lock
[
.B -p
] [
.B -t timeout
]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lock
requests a password from the user, reads it again for verification
and then will normally not relinquish the terminal until the password is
repeated.
There are two other conditions under which it will terminate: it
will timeout after some interval of time and it may be killed by someone
with the appropriate permission.
The default time limit is 15 minutes, which may be changed with the
.I -t
option where
.I timeout
is the time limit in minutes.
The
.I -p
option causes
.I lock
to use the user's current password instead of requesting another one.
