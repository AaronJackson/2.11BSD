this version of pi has been munged to supposedly make it portable
between a vax and an 11.  it seems to run on a vax, but hasn't been
ported back to an 11.

known changes from the 11 version:
    -   if VAX is defined, pointers (for pointer variables, files,
    and with pointers are allocated 4 bytes, instead of 2 for 11's.
    appropriate opcodes are put out for these variables.
    -   stdio is used for input and listing files.
    -   a lot of type casting has been done.
    -   the whole ball of wax is written in c.  all the as stuff
    was rewritten.  this necessitated changing calls to put[345]
    with long or double arguments to call put directly.

known bugs in the version 7 version:
    -   since atof now dies with an illegal instruction,
    pi dies if you have a floating constant too large for the machine.
    -   if a listing is redirected, sometimes the last buffer gets
    written out twice.

things we decided not to do:
    -   no attempt was made to maek the added address space available.
    stack frames are still limited to 50000 bytes.
    -   no attempt has been made to clean up any more than we had to
    or to get pi to lint.
