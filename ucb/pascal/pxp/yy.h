 * Yychar has value YEOF at end of file, and negative value if
 * there is no yychar, e.g. after a shift in the parser.

 * The variable yycol is the current column in the line whose number
 * is given by yyline.  Yyecol and yyeline give the position for an
 * error message to flag, usually the start of an input token.
 * Yylval is the semantic return from the scanner.
 *
 * In fact all of these variables are "per token".
 * In the usual case, only the copies in the scanner token structure
 * 'Y' are used, and the #defines below serve to make them look
 * like variables.
 *
 * For the purposes of the error recovery, however, they are copied
 * and restored quite freely.  For the error recovery also, the
 * file name which the input line this token is on and the seek
 * pointer of this line in its source file are saved as yyefile
 * and yyseekp.  The global variable yylinpt is the seek pointer
 * of the current input line.

 *	   and "until" at zero cost (safe since these are know to match
 *	   stack that cannot have been generated - e.g. "begin" or "repeat")
 *
 *	3) We never panic more than once from a given state without
 *	   shifting over input, i.e. we force the parse stack to shrink
