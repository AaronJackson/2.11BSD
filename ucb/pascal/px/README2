This directory contains the interpreter for Pascal.
Use the script "install" to install it.
If you have
	1. An 11/34
	2. An 11/40
	3. An 11/45 or 11/70 without floating point and with no
	   "fetch from I space system call (nominally no. 61.)
then you will want to use the NOID binaries:
	mv a.outNOID a.out
before you install if you have floating point and an 11/34 or 11/40,
	mv a.outNOIDNOFP a.out
before you install otherwise.
